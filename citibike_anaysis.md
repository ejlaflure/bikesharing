## Comparing Des Moines to New York City
The size and structure of New York City and Des Moines differ greatly in many respects.

### Size and Demographic Differences
New York City’s population and size are much larger then Des Moines. New York City's population is 39 times larger then Des Moines and has over three times more land mass. These numbers are pretty dounting for Des Moines's Citi Bike prospects, but Des Moines's demographics tell a different story. Based on New York City's Citi Bike data, the key user demograpic are males in their late 20s and early 30s. Des Moines has 1.5% more men the median age is 2 years younger then New York City's. This means Des Moines has more of Citi Bike's key demographic in their smaller population. Another key factor in looking forward to the future is Des Monies is growing at a rate of 7.11% while New York City is only growing by 2.7%. This means our prospects will look better and better as time goes on!

### Advantages of Des Moines's Small Size
Considering Des Moines's smaller land mass, this might be looked at as a disadvatage for the city, but the structure of the city's layout can allow Citi Bike to take advatage of this. Studying a key business in Des Moines like McDonalds, a much dencer business district for its size begins to reviel itself. In Des Moines, there are 3 times more McDonalds per square mile then in New York City. This means that if a person wants to get to a specific business in the city they will have a much shorter distance to travel then in New York City. Becasue of this, there is a more likely chance that people could use citi bikes to travel throughout the city when visiting or even commuting to work. In addition, since this is a much smaller area, it will require a much lower initial investment to get Citi Bike started in Des Moines.

## Taking an Unique Approach in Des Moines
Since Des Moines does not have the capability to use a mass quanity of locations and potental users to support the business like New York City, it is important to maxamize the usage of each Citi Bike location so the low investment can have a greater return. 

### Utilizing Established Bike Tour Routes
Des Moines already has established biking tour routes throughout the city. These routes tie into the tightly nit business community, popular farmers markets and other outdoor actives. Initially focussing the Citi Bike intilations along these routes and adding more locations in heavily used areas will limit investing in low fequenscy locations. Once these locations within the city are successfully fleshed out, another unique approch to the Des Moines area can be used to connect and expand outside of the inner city. This approch is the utilization of popular hiking and cycling trails in the area.

### Expanding into Mountain Bike Trails
Although the New York data does not diectly support utilizing mountain bike trails, it does show popularity around New York City's State Park. The advantage of utizing established hiking and cycling trails is that the potental Citi Bike locations are already established. Pick up and drop off stations can be placed at every trailhead allowing for quick and easy access. Since people in this area already what to exercise and enjoy nature, the likelyhood of some of them taking the opertunity to try out biking the trails is high. This is an oppertinity to expand into new markets giving the business the capability to expand outside of major city districts. 

## Unique Approaches Create Unique Investment Opportunities
Although this is a truely unique approch to establishing a Citi Bike business, these specifically targeted approches, along with the tightly nit business district, will allow us to maximize the usage of Citi Bike loactions in the area with a limited inital investment.
